# Snake_game

*How to play*

The player maneuvers a yellow line (i.e. the snake) inside a board using the following control buttons: W (up), D (right), A (left) and S (down). If the snake touches the outer lines of the board or its body, it's game over. At the start of the game there is a red square (i.e. the apple) inside the board. While eating each apple, by running into them with the head of the snake, the snake gets longer thus making it difficult to control while the game progresses.
	The aim of the game is for the snake to eat as many apples as possible without touching its body or the outer lines of the board.
